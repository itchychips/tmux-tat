A collection of tmux scripts to handle multiple tmux servers.

tat - tmux attach wrapper
    Usage: tat session_name [socket_name]

tnew - tmux new-session wrapper
    Usage: tnew session_name [socket_name]

tls - tmux list-session wrapper
    Usage: tls

Given a session_name, the socket_name (see `man tmux` for the -L option) will
create or attach to a different socket name.  If socket_name is not given, then
"default" is assumed.

tat will attach to the given session name, obeying tmux's naming rules (such as
shortened session name).  It will search all tmux servers based on the sockets
listed in "$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-$(id -g)" (TMUX_TMPDIR is set to /tmp by default).
It will attach to the first session it finds.

tnew will create a new session.  This is a quick wrapper that is shorter than
`tmux [-L socket_name] new-session session_name`.

tls will loop through all found servers and print their sessions.  If a socket
is not currently hosting a server, it will still print an error message from
tmux.
